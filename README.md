The Cracker Barrel golf tee puzzle is a classic brain teaser that involves arranging 15 golf tees (or pegs) in an equilateral triangle on a board. Initially the board looks as follows:
>
            O
          O   O
        O   O   O
      O   O   O   O
    O   O   O   O   O


One peg is then removed creating an available hole.  The goal is to jump over each peg with another peg, removing the jumped-over peg, until only one remains. 

Here, we recreate this puzzle on the Apple Watch with SwiftUI 5.
