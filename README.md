The Cracker Barrel golf tee puzzle is a classic brain teaser that involves arranging 15 golf tees (or pegs) in an equilateral triangle on a board. One peg is then removed creating an available hole.  The goal is to jump over each peg with another peg, removing the jumped-over peg, until only one remains. 

Here, we recreate this puzzle on the Apple Watch with SwiftUI 5.
